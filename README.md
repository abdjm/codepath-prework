## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random (To generate random numbers)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12543697/setting-an-image-button-in-css-imageactive (How to set an image/gif for a button)
Plus all of the links that were scattered throughout the walkthrough for the prework assignment.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The first challenge was myself. From learning about this opportunity I was excited to be a part of it, but after learning that the first part requires me to 
create a program using three languages I had not interacted with before worried me. I then calmed myself down and just started to approach the problem and tried to see what was going to be needed. Once I saw that the problem was already broken down for me, I just got to work and started chipping away at it little by little.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I'm curious as to what the specific role of a web developer is. So far in this assignment, the task given seems to also be able to be created in python/java, so are there more specific things that CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time on the project I would try and fulfill more of the optional tasks. The first one being how to give the player multiple attempts. Memories can sometimes fade quickly and giving someone an extra chance to try again would help. The second task is changing the sound that is played. I would want to replicate some sort of well known song/jingle and have the playback pattern replicate the sounds so when the player reaches the final levels they can start to hear the whole song.
